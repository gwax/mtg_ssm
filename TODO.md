# TODO

-   Group sets by parent set is xlsx output
    -   Block? probably not
    -   At the very least, merge promos into somewhere?
-   Filter card types as well as set types to remove tokens and such in promo sets
-   Option to filter out non-English sets / cards
-   diffs to stdout
-   Use setuptools-scm so I don't have to think about releases as much
