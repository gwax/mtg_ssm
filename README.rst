`mtg-ssm`_ is a tool for creating/updating user-friendly spreadsheets with
Magic: the Gathering collection information. The tool can also
import/export data to/from these spreadsheets to other formats, such as
CSV files.

.. _mtg-ssm: https://github.com/gwax/mtg_ssm

As a matter of convenience, you can store the created spreadsheet in
Dropbox, Google Drive, or the like and access your collection from
anywhere.

Installation
============

mtg-ssm is available on PyPI so, if you have python (>=3.6) and pip
installed on your system, you should be able to get mtg-ssm by entering
the following into a terminal:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install mtg_ssm

Updates can be performed by entering:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -U mtg_ssm

You can verify installation from the terminal by running:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm --help

Usage
=====

For first time use, you will want to create an empty spreadsheet with
card data:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm create collection.xlsx

In the future, when new sets are released, you will want to update your
collection spreadsheet while keeping existing counts:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm update collection.xlsx

Existing collections
--------------------

If you already have your cards in another collection store, you might
want to import that collection into your card spreadsheet.

First create an input csv file:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm create input_data.csv

Then modify the template to match your counts and import into your
spreadsheet:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm merge collection.xlsx input_data.csv

Troubleshooting
===============

Windows 7 and up
----------------

Certain unicode characters (such as U+2605 ★) may not be mapped
correctly on Windows systems, causing errors when mtg-ssm tries
to map data from Scryfall.  This can occur in Command Prompt,
Powershell, or other terminal emulators that rely on the system
region settings (Such as MSYS2 MinGW).  The below steps should
help to resolve this issue.

-   Open up Control panel.
-   Go to Clock and Region.
-   Click Region.
-   Go to the Administrative tab (second tab)
-   Click Change System Locale.
-   Check "Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support".
-   Restart your computer.

LibreOffice
-----------

#NAME?
~~~~~~

LibreOffice has a different format from Excel for handling cross-worksheet
cell references (`=LEA.A7` instead of Excel's standard `=LEA!A7`). If you
open a mtg_ssm spreadsheet in LibreOffice, by default you will see `#NAME?`
in all of your have references (counts of cards from other sets).

To fix this, you need to tell LibreOffice to use the "Excel A1" format for
calculating formulas.

Bring up options/preferences

**Tools -> Options**

or on Mac

**LibreOffice -> Preferences**

Then configure the format to Excel A1:

**LibreOffice Calc -> Formula -> Formula syntax = Excel A1**

Acknowledgments
===============

-   `Wizards of the Coast`_: For making Magic: the Gathering and continuing
    to support it. Off and on, it's been my favorite hobby since the
    early '90s.
-   `Scryfall`_: Scryfall is a fantastic resource for anyone trying to lookup
    cards or build software on top of up to date Magic card information.
-   `MTG JSON`_: MTG JSON is an amazing resource for anyone looking to build
    tools around magic card data. Before Scryfall, MTG JSON was my primary
    source for card data and, without it, mtg-ssm would not exist.

Changelog
=========

Development
-----------

-   Fix filtering of digital only cards
-   Switch from inclusion to exclusion for set types
-   Add exclusion of card layouts (to catch tokens in non-token sets)

2.3.0
-----

-   Add card prices and totals

2.2.5
-----

-   Officially support Python 3.11

2.2.4
-----

-   Fixes for Scryfall model changes

2.2.3
-----

-   Fix xlsx haverefs for sets with codes that begin with numbers

2.2.1
-----

-   Create temporary file in same folder as target to avoid cross-volume link
    issues. This solves an issue with storing collection files in Google Drive
    now that Google Drive uses a mounted virtual volume instead of mirroring
    files to your local machine.

2.2.0
-----

-   Build and release using GitHub Actions
-   Switch over to pydantic for Scryfall data deserialization
-   Bug fixes for newer sets that do not include a numeric component to ther
    collector numbers.

2.1.3
-----

-   Update models to match scryfall as of 2020-09-09
-   Cache failures on model change fixes

2.1.1
-----

-   Fix Scryfall data fetching on Windows.
-   Update models to match scryfall as of 2020-02-08

2.1.0
-----

-   Add support for filtering card data by set type

    -   For example, `mtg_ssm --set-types token,emblem create tokens.xlsx` to
        create a spreadsheet for tracking tokens and emblems.

2.0.1
-----

-   Updated models to match scryfall as of 2019-09-10

2.0.0
-----

-   Switched from mtgjson to Scryfall as a data source
-   Broke existing spreadsheets

    -   ``update`` will rebuild / upgrade existing sheets

    -   rebuild lookup doesn't work very well for basic lands, double check
        your counts

    -   rebuild lookup may result in double counting for Flip / split / DFC
        cards, double-check your counts

    -   a number of cards count not reliably be remapped and will raise
        exceptions; if you have any copies of these cards, you will need
        to remove them from your existing spreadsheet and re-add them
        after the update

    -   promo cards are particularly hard hit as Scryfall and MTGJSON model
        promo sets very differently.

-----

-   Removed support for Python 3.3

    -   create: create a new collection
    -   update: update an existing collection
