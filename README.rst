`mtg-ssm`_ is a tool for creating/updating user-friendly spreadsheets with
Magic: the Gathering collection information. The tool can also
import/export data to/from these spreadsheets to other formats, such as
CSV files.

.. _mtg-ssm: https://github.com/gwax/mtg_ssm

As a matter of convenience, you can store the created spreadsheet in
Dropbox, Google Drive, or the like and access your collection from
anywhere.

Installation
============

mtg-ssm is available on PyPI so, if you have python (>=3.6) and pip
installed on your system, you should be able to get mtg-ssm by entering
the following into a terminal:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install mtg_ssm

Updates can be performed by entering:

.. code:: bash

    pip3 install -U mtg_ssm

You can verify installation from the terminal by running:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm --help

Usage
=====

For first time use, you will want to create an empty spreadsheet with
card data:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm create collection.xlsx

In the future, when new sets are released, you will want to update your
collection spreadsheet while keeping existing counts:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm update collection.xlsx

Existing collections
--------------------

If you already have your cards in another collection store, you might
want to import that collection into your card spreadsheet.

First create an input csv file:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm create input_data.csv

Then modify the template to match your counts and import into your
spreadsheet:

.. code:: bash

    mtg-ssm merge collection.xlsx input_data.csv

Acknowledgments
===============

-   `Wizards of the Coast`_: For making Magic: the Gathering and continuing
    to support it. Off and on, it's been my favorite hobby since the
    early '90s.
-   `Scryfall`_: Scryfall is a fantastic resource for anyone trying to lookup
    cards or build software on top of up to date Magic card information.
-   `MTG JSON`_: MTG JSON is an amazing resource for anyone looking to build
    tools around magic card data. Before Scryfall, MTG JSON was my primary
    source for card data and, without it, mtg-ssm would not exist.

Changelog
=========

2.0.0
-----

-   Switched from mtgjson to Scryfall as a data source
-   Broke existing spreadsheets

    -   ``update`` will rebuild / upgrade existing sheets

    -   rebuild lookup doesn't work very well for basic lands, double check
        your counts

    -   rebuild lookup may result in double counting for Flip / split / DFC
        cards, double-check your counts

    -   a number of cards count not reliably be remapped and will raise
        exceptions; if you have any copies of these cards, you will need
        to remove them from your existing spreadsheet and re-add them
        after the update

    -   promo cards are particularly hard hit as Scryfall and MTGJSON model
        promo sets very differently.

-----

-   Removed support for Python 3.3
